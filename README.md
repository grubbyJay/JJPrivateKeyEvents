JJPrivateKeyEvents
==================
** THIS LIBRARY USES UNDOCUMENTED METHODS THAT WILL GET YOUR APP REJECTED BY APPLE **
Take special care to only include this library in your debug target.
This library allows you to capture global keystroke events for debugging purposes in the iOS simulator.  Inspired by a talk given by Flipboard.
